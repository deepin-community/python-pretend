Description: Python library for stubbing (Python 3)
 Pretend is a library to make stubbing with Python easier.
 .
 Stubbing is a technique for writing tests. You may hear the term mixed up with
 mocks, fakes, or doubles. Basically a stub is an object that returns pre-canned
 responses, rather than doing any computation.
